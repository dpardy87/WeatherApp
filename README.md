# WeatherApp
Test Project for Small Weather Application

### A small weather application should be created with following basic functionalities:
1. Show three tabs with predefined cities (Rio de Janeiro, Beijing and Los Angeles)
1. Connect to a backend to get the weather data
1. Show for the selected city a forecast for the next hours and the next days should be presented
1. The user should get the ability to refresh the data
1. On the next page is a mockup for the small weather application
1. Weather icons are available at https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions
1. Bonus: allow to search for a city


### For the backend following JSON rest API will be used:
1. The API documentation can be found here: https://openweathermap.org/api
1. The used access key for the API is REDACTED
1. The API key is used for the free subscription plan, so please ensure to use the API functions which are available for that subscription plan
1. Please use the API responsibly and keep in mind that excessive or misuse can lead to temporary blockages
1. If your key gets temporarily blocked, please get in touch with us and you can get another key
1. Under the link the usage and samples can be found
1. Bonus: use the small city meta data https://www.weatherbit.io/api/meta (the one with ~20,000 cities) for the city search
